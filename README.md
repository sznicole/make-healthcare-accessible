# Make Healthcare Accessible
This was one of my earlier projects when I first learned how to code. The website focuses on advocating for healthcare accessibility, implementing videos, fact generator, and a script generator via HTML, CSS, and Javascript to encourage learning and advocacy. This project taught me how to use event listeners, link files, and fun HTML/CSS uses (I was able to make a gradient background with CSS and a video grid with HTML/CSS).
